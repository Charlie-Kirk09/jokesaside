# UniInfo Production Deployment & DevOps Playbook

This guide outlines the production deployment architectures, configuration guidelines, and operations procedures for deploying **UniInfo** using our containerized, reverse-proxied, high-performance architecture.

---

## 1. Environment Configurations (`.env`)

Ensure the following variables are securely configured in your production environment:

```ini
# Production Mode & Node Settings
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Primary Relational Datastore (Supabase / Managed PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@your-supabase-host.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require

# External AI Provider Keys
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...

# Security & Session Retention
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

---

## 2. Docker Architecture Overview

Our containerized architecture consists of two tightly integrated layers:
1. **Application Container (`app`)**: A multi-stage, minimized Node.js container compiling React assets with Vite, bundling the server with ESBuild, and running the standalone Express server.
2. **Reverse Proxy Container (`web`)**: An Alpine-based Nginx container acting as an edge layer, handling Gzip compression, rate limiting (up to 15 r/s with a burst allowance of 30), SSL termination, and security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options).

## 3. Platform Deployment Guides

### Option A: Ubuntu VPS (Virtual Private Server)

This is the recommended approach for complete administrative control and cost-efficiency.

#### Prerequisite: Install Docker & Docker Compose
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository & Configure Env
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/uniinfo.git /var/www/uniinfo
cd /var/www/uniinfo
cp .env.example .env
nano .env # Insert production DATABASE_URL and GROQ_API_KEY
```

#### Step 2: Spin Up the Stack
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
Verify container statuses:
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f app
```

#### Step 3: Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt (Certbot)
To transition from HTTP to secure HTTPS:
1. Ensure your domain's DNS `A` record points to your VPS IP address.
2. Run Certbot in standalone mode to obtain certificates:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y certbot
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
   ```
3. Copy or mount certificates into the Nginx container, update `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to uncomment the `443 ssl` block and change `yourdomain.com` to your actual domain.
4. Reload Nginx:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web nginx -s reload
   ```

### Option B: AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

AWS EC2 is ideal for highly scalable enterprise setups.

#### Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance
- **AMI**: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS.
- **Instance Type**: `t3.micro` (eligible for Free Tier) or `t3.small` (for better build performances).
- **Security Group Rules**:
  - Port `22` (SSH) - restricted to your IP address.
  - Port `80` (HTTP) - open to `0.0.0.0/0`.
  - Port `443` (HTTPS) - open to `0.0.0.0/0`.

#### Step 2: Provision Docker and Deploy
SSH into your instance and follow the **Ubuntu VPS** instructions to install Docker and pull the stack.

#### Step 3: High Availability Option (ALB & ACM)
For enterprise scalability, bypass Certbot on the instance and utilize AWS infrastructure:
1. Issue an SSL certificate via **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**.
2. Launch an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** listening on `443` with the ACM certificate.
3. Route traffic to target instances on HTTP Port `80`.
4. Update Security Groups so only the ALB can communicate with your EC2 instances.

### Option C: Railway

Railway provides a high-performance PaaS environment with native zero-downtime rollouts.

#### Step 1: Deploy from GitHub
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway.
2. Select **New Project** -> **Deploy from GitHub repo**.

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
In the Railway Dashboard under **Variables**, set:
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `PORT` = `3000`
- `DATABASE_URL` = Your Supabase/PostgreSQL connection string
- `GROQ_API_KEY` = Your secret key

#### Step 3: Build & Route Settings
- Railway automatically detects the `Dockerfile` and triggers a multi-stage optimized build.
- Railway will expose public domain ingress on your configured port (Port 3000 mapped). It manages SSL termination automatically at the platform edge.

### Option D: Render

Render offers fully managed cloud application services with automated deployments on git pushes.

#### Step 1: Create a Web Service
1. Navigate to your Render Dashboard and click **New** -> **Web Service**.
2. Connect your Git repository.

#### Step 2: Set Instance Settings
- **Language**: `Docker` (Render will build directly using your optimized multi-stage `Dockerfile`).
- **Region**: Select the region closest to your PostgreSQL database to minimize query latencies.

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In the service's **Environment** tab, specify:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`

Render automatically provisions SSL certificates for your custom domains and handles container health monitoring out of the box.

## 4. CI/CD Automated Workflow (GitHub Actions)

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are fully integrated through GitHub Actions:

- **Quality Gate (`ci.yml`)**: Triggered on pull requests to ensure all code compiles perfectly (`npm run lint`), TypeScript checks pass, and tests execute with green statuses.
- **Publish & Release (`deploy.yml`)**: Triggered on push to `main` or `production` branches. It:
  1. Runs all quality tests.
  2. Compiles production-optimized JS and bundles the backend server.
  3. Builds and pushes the Docker container to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.
  4. Triggers an automated rollout on your VPS over SSH by pulling the fresh container and executing zero-downtime hot recreation.

To configure CD, define these secrets in your GitHub repository (**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**):
- `DEPLOY_HOST`: The IP or domain of your VPS.
- `DEPLOY_USERNAME`: Usually `ubuntu` or `root`.
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your secure SSH private key corresponding to authorized hosts.

## 5. Operations & Health Metrics

- **Real-Time Logs**: `docker-compose logs -f app`
- **Container Health**: Use the automated check `/api/health` returning system memory, database connectivity, and uptime.
- **Prometheus Metrics**: High-performance plain-text Prometheus exporter integrated at `/metrics` monitoring heap memory and database counters.
